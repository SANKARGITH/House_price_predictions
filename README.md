# Demo: 
![Screenshot 2025-03-30 091343](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb0c936e-e7fb-45c9-b6e0-c3575844169d)

## Project Description
This project predicts house prices in Bangalore using a Linear Regression model. The application is built from scratch, combining machine learning techniques with a user-friendly web interface. It leverages data preprocessing, model training, and prediction using Python and popular libraries. The frontend provides a simple and interactive way to predict house prices based on user input.

## Features
- Predict house prices based on input features (e.g., location, size, number of bedrooms).
- User-friendly web interface to input data and view predictions.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Model training using Linear Regression.
- Real-time predictions using a Flask API.

## Technologies Used
- Python (for data analysis and model building)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model development and experimentation)
- PyCharm (for backend development)
- Flask (for building the API)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for data processing and model building)

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SANKARGITH/House_price_predictions
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd house-price-prediction        
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:5000`.

## Usage
1. Enter the required house features on the UI.
2. Click on the 'Predict' button.
3. View the predicted house price.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating more advanced machine learning models.
- Improving UI/UX for better user interaction.
- Adding more features for prediction accuracy.
